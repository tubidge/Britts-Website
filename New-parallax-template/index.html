          <h4>About Brittany</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">
            Brittany Cates is an incredibly fun person to be around, she has an amazing energy about her, and a very
            uplifting personality. Her friends say “She can change someone’s mood instantly just because she is always
            the happy one in the room!” She cares deeply for every person she comes in contact with, and always wants to
            make sure they know she is truly concerned about their wellbeing, and what their current needs are.
            Brittany has alove for new adventures,and is always looking for ways to create exciting memories, and
            experiences with others. She spends most of her free time outdoors under the sun. She sees the importance
            of taking a break from her daily responsibilities, and clearing her own head so that she can continue to
            give freely to those around her. She prefers to do this by practicing yoga, and has a strong appreciation
            for what yoga does for her personally.
            <br><br>

            Brittany is not only known for being a loving and caring individual, but she has a reputation for being an
            extremely
            hard worker who is goal oriented. She is always determined to reach expectations she sets for herself.
            Anyone that gets
            to know her, sees that she is quite the ambitious 22-year-old. It is this combination of personality traits
            that made
            Brittany decide to open up her own massage practice. She found her passion for massage because of what it
            can do for
            people mentally, physically, and emotionally. She is able to facilitate healing on a daily basis by
            providing
            individuals her time and attention during a session. Her work is a combination of Deep Tissue, Trigger
            Point, and
            Injury. Brittany prides herself in being able to make sessions like these still very connective and
            relaxing, so that
            her clients are able to unwind and work on the mental/emotional side of things, while she works on the
            outer, and
            physical side of things. Brittany sincerely believes the most important thing a therapist can offer to their
            clients is
            a mindful, considerate, and loving presence. This type of compassion facilitates the innate healing ability
            within the
            recipient more so than any technique.
            <br><br>

            Brittany and her brother James are both therapists and decided back in 2015 to open up their own practice
            together so
            that they could provide the type of service to their clients they truly believe is effective. Some of the
            core values
            they choose to live by are the following: Continuous improvement, Facilitate healing, Meticulous,
            Honest/trustworthy A
            commitment to doing good for the whole (Total Wellness), A commitment to innovation and excellence,
            Respected,
            Passionate, Inspirational. They want to do all they can in their power to bring their clients back to a
            balanced,
            mental, emotional, and physical state. Their peace, comfort, and happiness is what bring James and Brittany
            the most
            Joy.
